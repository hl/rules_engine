import Config

# Configuration for RulesEngine fact schema registry
# In production, you would typically configure your own schema provider
# config :rules_engine,
#   schema_registry: MyApp.SchemaRegistry

# Example using a module-based schema provider:
# config :rules_engine,
#   schema_registry: {MyApp.SchemaProvider, []}

# For development/testing, schemas can be loaded from modules or files
