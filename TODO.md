# TODO

A curated, actionable backlog to take RulesEngine from prototype to robust, documented library. Prioritised by impact and dependency.

## 0. Immediate hygiene

- [x] Replace README placeholder with real overview, usage, and examples (install, quickstart, compile DSL to IR, link to specs)
- [x] Pin supported Elixir version (1.18 stable) and CI matrix; resolved Dialyzer issues
- [x] Ensure all public modules have @moduledoc and functions have @doc/@specs
- [x] Add license file and project metadata (description, source_url, docs) in mix.exs
- [x] Enable strict compiler flags in mix.exs (warnings_as_errors in CI env) and ensure zero warnings

## 1. DSL parsing and validation

- [x] Extend grammar to cover:
  - [x] Negation/exists in when: not/exists forms (grammar + AST tags)
  - [x] Accumulate/group-by syntax as per specs/accumulation.md
  - [x] More boolean/collection ops (overlap, starts_with, contains) if part of DSL and Predicates
- [x] Implement parser recovery and human-readable errors (file:line, caret context)
- [x] Normalise AST format (consistent then/when tuple handling) and add type for AST nodes
- [x] Validation improvements:
  - [x] Cross-check bindings across all guard contexts (including nested and/or)
  - [x] Validate accumulate reducers and having clauses (types, names)
  - [x] Enforce allowed fields using fact schema registry; surface context-rich paths
  - [x] Predicate type expectation enforcement aligned with RulesEngine.Predicates.expectations/1

## 2. IR compilation

- [x] Build real Alpha network from fact patterns with index hints (op selectivity)
- [x] Build Beta network joins from guards and inter-binding comparisons
- [x] Encode not/exists nodes into network with correct semantics
- [x] Add action compilation to IR (emit, call, log actions with full schema compliance)
- [x] Implement accumulate nodes:
  - [x] Sum, count, min, max, avg reducers with proper IR encoding
  - [x] Group-by key encoding and incremental update policy
  - [x] Reducer bindings available in action clauses
  - [x] Having filters at compile-time into network nodes (parsed and stored in IR)
- [x] Add agenda policy data in IR (salience, recency, tiebreakers) from specs/agenda.md
- [x] Include refraction settings per rule (from specs/refraction.md)
- [x] Attach source map info (byte offsets) to IR nodes for traceability
- [x] Schema conformance hardening: round-trip cast where feasible before validate()

## 3. Engine runtime (OTP)

- [x] Define engine GenServer with:
  - [x] APIs: start/stop tenant, assert/modify/retract facts, run/step, reset, snapshot
  - [x] Working memory structures: alpha memories, beta memories, token tables, agenda queue
  - [x] Deterministic batch processing boundaries
- [x] Implement agenda policy module behaviour; default policy with salience + recency
- [x] Refraction store to avoid duplicate fires across stable inputs
- [x] Action RHS execution:
  - [x] Emit derived facts back into WM with lineage
  - [x] Optional callback hooks
- [x] Tracing bus:
  - [x] Node-level events (assert/retract, join, activation, fire)
  - [x] Token lineage, activation lifecycle events
  - [x] Pluggable subscribers

## 4. Fact schemas

- [x] Schema registry module with external configuration support
- [x] Remove built-in domain-specific schemas from library

## 5. Standard library of predicates and calculators

- [x] Implement calculator functions referenced in DSL:
  - [x] time_between/3, bucket/2-3, decimal_* and dec/1
  - [x] Domain calculators as per specs/calculators.md
